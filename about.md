### About Me

I'm Dhoomil Sheta. I currently work as Specialist Programmer in Expert Track at Infosys. Through this blog, I'll try to share my experiences and experiments with technology and life. My posts may not be purely informative as they are represent experiments which may be big fails as well, but I'd still log them. My posts will cover topics related to various stacks.
