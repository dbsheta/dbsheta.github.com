### About Me

I'm **Dhoomil Sheta**. I currently work as a **Specialist Programmer** in Strategic Technologies Division(STG) at Infosys. 

Through this blog, I'll try to share my experiments and experiences with recent advancements in tech. 

I will be sharing experimenal articles and try to give my honest point of view irrespective of the technology I'm experimenting. I've seen people trying to portray a donkey as a unicorn. The articles will be as honest as possible and maybe I'd even end up concluding `unicorn == donkey` if they both seem indifferent for the use-case under consideration. 

Having said that, My posts may not always be purely informative as they are experiments. Some of them may be flops as well, but I'd still share them as it was a lesson for me and save your time as well (if you were planning to go down the same road!). 

Let me know if you'd like to collaborate for trying out some new frameworks/technologies!
